# Alchemy's Road to Web3 Week 6

This repository covers the modified code following Alchemy's Road to Web3 Week 6.

## Development Environment Setup

Ensure you have yarn and npm available. Under the `./challenge-1-decentralized-staking` directory, execute the following:

    yarn install

To deploy and start the contract, execute the following:

    yarn chain
    yarn deploy --reset

Next, to start the web front end, execute the following:

    yarn start

Note, you will need to have the chain running the deploy to the local hardhat chain.

## Personal Note

The React application code written for this challenge is some of the worst React code I've ever seen. I say this not to lay shame on anyone, but to simply absolve myself of how bad it is being that I didn't take the time to reorganize and rewrite it for this exercise.
